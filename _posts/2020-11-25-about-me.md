With a lifelong fascination for infectious diseases and a passion for public health, I have directed my career towards a passion of developing new ways to unravel complex biological questions. I am currently a Senior Genomics and Data Scientist at the [Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene (WSLH)](http://www.slh.wisc.edu/) where I lead a team of incredibly talented and dedicated public health data scientists. My work involves a combination microbiology, bioinformatics, statistics, and software development and I spend most of my time applying novel computational methodologies and building genomics and data analytics capacity leveraging emerging cloud-based technology both within the WSLH and the greater public health community.

A few notable projects that I have led include an easy to use web-based platform for performing bioinformatic workflows [Easy Genomics](https://www.easygenomics.org/), a repository of containerized applications [StaPH-B Docker Builds](https://github.com/StaPH-B/docker-builds); a toolkit of software and workflows for public health bioinformaticians [StaPH-B ToolKit](https://github.com/StaPH-B/staphb_toolkit); and a dashboard for displaying SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in Wisconsin [WI SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Dashboard](https://dataportal.slh.wisc.edu/sc2dashboard). You can find most of my work on my personal github [<i class='fab fa-github'></i> k-florek](https://github.com/k-florek/) or our lab's github [<i class='fab fa-github'></i> wslh-bio](https://github.com/wslh-bio) or [<i class='fab fa-github'></i> wslh-data](https://github.com/wslh-data). These projects are built using technologies including AWS, Terraform, Nextflow, Python, R, Bash, Nodejs, Docker, and include a variety of genomics, machine learning, and evolutionary biology tools.

My work frequently involves close collaboration with the [Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL)](https://www.aphl.org/) and the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) [Office of Advanced Molecular Detection (OAMD)](https://www.cdc.gov/amd/index.html) to develop pathways towards enhancing the public health workforce and improving access to data insights. I also serve as a steering committee member of [StaPH-B](http://www.staphb.org/) a consortium of public health bioinformaticians committed to addressing the barriers affecting genomics in state public health laboratories.  

In my spare time I enjoy creative ventures such as watercolor painting, photography, and board games along with active hobbies like backpacking and roller skating.
