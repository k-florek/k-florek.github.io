My work involves a combination microbiology, bioinformatics, statistics, and software development and I spend most of my time applying novel computational methodologies to preventing the spread of infectious diseases. At the [Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene (WSLH)](http://www.slh.wisc.edu/) my role is to help develop and build genomics and data analytics capacity both within the WSLH and the greater public health community.

A few notable projects that I have supported include a repository of containerized applications [StaPH-B Docker Builds](https://github.com/StaPH-B/docker-builds); a toolkit of software and workflows for public health bioinformaticians [StaPH-B ToolKit](https://github.com/StaPH-B/staphb_toolkit); and a dashboard for displaying SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillence in Wisconsin [WI SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Dashboard](https://dataportal.slh.wisc.edu/sc2dashboard). You can find most of my work on [github <i class='fab fa-github'></i>](https://github.com/k-florek/). The technologies I use include AWS, Nextflow, Python, R, Bash, Nodejs, Docker, as well as a variety of genomics, machine learning, and evolutionary biology tools.

In an effort to build up the capacity of bioinformatics in the United States I am a steering committee member of [StaPH-B](http://www.staphb.org/) a consortium of public health bioinformaticians committed to addressing the barriers affecting genomics in state public health laboratories. I also participate in a number of workgroups and committees hosted by [Association of Public Health Laboratories](https://www.aphl.org/) and the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) that function to build standards and resources for public health bioinformatics.

In my spare time I enjoy photography, watercolor, cooking, plants, rollerskating, and board games.
