Starting from a fascination with host-virus interactions and a desire to improve the world around me I have sought out a career in microbiology where I am currently a Senior Genomics and Data Scientist at the [Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene (WSLH)](http://www.slh.wisc.edu/). Borne out of a love for data I specialize in developing and implementing cloud based solutions to solve complex genomic and biological questions. My work involves a combination microbiology, bioinformatics, statistics, and software development and I spend most of my time applying novel computational methodologies and building genomics and data analytics capacity both within the [WSLH](http://www.slh.wisc.edu/) and the greater public health community.

A few notable projects that I have supported include a repository of containerized applications [StaPH-B Docker Builds](https://github.com/StaPH-B/docker-builds); a toolkit of software and workflows for public health bioinformaticians [StaPH-B ToolKit](https://github.com/StaPH-B/staphb_toolkit); and a dashboard for displaying SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in Wisconsin [WI SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Dashboard](https://dataportal.slh.wisc.edu/sc2dashboard). You can find most of my work on [github <i class='fab fa-github'></i>](https://github.com/k-florek/). These projects include a variety of technologies including AWS, Terraform, Nextflow, Python, R, Bash, Nodejs, Docker, as well as a variety of genomics, machine learning, and evolutionary biology tools.

To further the advancement bioinformatics in public health I am is a steering committee member of [StaPH-B](http://www.staphb.org/) a consortium of public health bioinformaticians committed to addressing the barriers affecting genomics in state public health laboratories. My work involves working closely with the [Association of Public Health Laboratories](https://www.aphl.org/) and the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) to develop pathways towards enhancing the public health workforce and improving access to data insights. 

In my spare time I enjoy creative ventures such as watercolor painting, photography, and board games along with active hobbies like hiking and roller skating.
